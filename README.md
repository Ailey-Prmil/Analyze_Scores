I curled the data from website and made some insights out of it
There are currently 4 Questions I want to know about the data
_Q1 : Which subject did each student receive with the highest score ? (done)
_Q2 : Pho diem theo khoi (A0,A1,B0,B1)
_Q3 : Bar chart describes the number of students could not score over 1 in tandem with the number of students scoring 10
_Q4 : KHTN and KHXH, which have higher score?
